Dope is a small WSGI application, that allows you to host files on a server (similiar to services like Rapidshare, etc). At the moment, it simply scratches my own itch and lacks features.

Notes
=====
* If you use SQLite as your database backend, ensure that you use a version > 0.9.1 (note the strict greater than!),
  otherwise the connection pooling of SQLAlchemy will mess up things a great deal
